Keeping To-Do lists, Calendars and Notes in one place

## Description

This is my first attempt at creating an app. I'm not too familiar with Swift so I'm learning as I go. I'm not really following any tutorials, moreso I'm freestyling here and there. Trying to learn Swift best practices but I will need to do more research (if anything looks bad practice, please let me know!)

## Progress Report

Today I switched the configuration of my app so that it integrated Core Data. This has modified how I set up the app so a lot of functionality has been lost. Will be updating so hopefully the to-do list pages will be functional by the end of the weekend.

## Question of the Week

What is it like to be a spider and to not only have 8 legs, but also 8 eyes?!
